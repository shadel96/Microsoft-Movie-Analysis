## Overview
This project uses datasets of recent movies' budgets, profits, and genres to analyze trends in what makes a profitable movie. Microsfot can use the conclusions drawn from this analysis to make decisions that will yield the highest profit when it begins creating it's own custom movie content.


## Data
The budget and income dataset used comes from The-Numbers.com, and all other movie information (such as release date, genre, and average review score) comes from IMDB. This data is used to create insightful visualizations so that Microsoft can make the most profitable choices in it's own content creation.


## Methods
By comparing movie profitability data to each film's release date, genre, review score, and budget over the course of several years, this analysis aims to demonstrate which of these decisions has the most impact on profitability. Furthermore, it will guide microsoft to making the appropriate choices to maximize profitability as related to these variables.


## Results
The results of the analysis clearly demonstrate that release timing and genre of film have a substantial impact on the profitability of a modern day movie. 

A films budget plays at least some role it's profitability, but this information is by no means the only or most sigificant measure of potential success.

Early Spring and Summer tend to see the highest profits overall. Around the Holidays, profitability rises again to a lesser extent.

Similarly, specific genres show clear profitability over others. Particularly Animated, Sci-Fi, Comedy, and Adventure films. These films also have month-specific correlations that are similar but not identical to overall movie profitability trends.

Lastly, there is limited evidence to suggest that understanding what sort of films yield the most positive reviews could also influence each film's profitability. This is not as crucial as the genre and release date, but nonetheless the correlation can benefit Microsoft going forward.

## Conclusion
Using this Data, Microsoft can guarantee it will make the safest and most profitable decisions when entering the movie industry.
